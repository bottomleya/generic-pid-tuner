# Discrete PID Controller Equation
https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/26537/what-is-a-definitive-discrete-pid-controller-equation

# System Dyanmics
Used first order equation equivalent to Netwon's Law Of Cooling:
f'(x) = k*(M - x)
where M is referred to as the "Constant Offset" - equivalent to ambient temperature
and k is referred to as the "Scaling Coefficient" - equivalent to Heat Transfer Coefficient




# Future Improvements
 - enable manual controller override checkbox functionality
 - implement basic PID tuning rule of thumbs
